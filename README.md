# eslint-react-jsx-indent

[![CI](https://github.com/meyfa/eslint-react-jsx-indent/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/meyfa/eslint-react-jsx-indent/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository is a minimal non-working example for
https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/3222.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm test`.

Errors will be reported for index.js and index-with-jsx.jsx about the
`react/jsx-indent` rule, which do not appear to be correct. 

Alternatively have a look at the Actions (CI) workflow of this repository.
